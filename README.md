You should do my code first set up a free account on Google colab since tensorflow is pre-installed and run it on gpu with high ram. Download this dataset. Im pretty sure you don't need directions. The dataset is right here. https://www.kaggle.com/pvaddina/pythons-vs-anacondas. Its very small dataset which which can make training and validation accuracy difficult. Thats why I had to experiment with the paramaters. Dont forget to do the test classifier.py just dowload a picture of an ball python, Burmese python, etc. Then an anaconda picture from Google. Or use my pictures that I provided.
